# Ensemble Forecasting Model

This repository contains a Python-based ensemble machine learning model that predicts:

- Total energy consumption
- Average temperature
- Average humidity
- COâ‚‚ levels

It uses:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Linear Regression

## Run Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib

2. Run the model

The model reads data, performs feature engineering, trains the ensemble, and outputs performance metrics and visual plots.
## Dataset

The dataset is too large to host on GitHub.
